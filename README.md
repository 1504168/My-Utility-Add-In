## Feature Lists for VBA Developers

### Import Code button
Import Code from Reusable Code Folder. There are 74 carefully crafted reusable code modules that can be imported into your project. These modules cover a wide range of functionalities. There are 37 code snippets that can be imported into current cursor location as well.

### Insert Code button
There are 55 code snippets that can be inserted into the current cursor location. And you can easily use your variable names in the code snippets. Like if your variable name is `Data` and you need to loop through your array then just click `Insert Code` just type `a2ltr` and select the `Array 2D Loop Through Row.txt` snippet. It will ask you to specify the Array variable name and you can type `Data` and it will insert the code for you. This way you can use your own variable names in the code snippets.

### Insert Constructor button
You have created a bean class with `n` number of properties and you want to create a constructor for that class. Just click `Insert Constructor` button and it will generate the constructor code for you.


### Enrich Code Library
You have found a code snippet that you are using frequently in your projects. You can enrich the code library by adding that code snippet to the reusable code folder. Just click `Enrich Code Library` button and it allow you to specify all the variables that you want to use in the code snippet. It will create a new code snippet file in the reusable code folder with the specified variables. You can then use this code snippet in your projects using `Insert Code` button. This way you can easily create your own code snippets and use them in your projects.

### Table Header
Sometimes we need to create constants or enum for table headers. You can easily create constants or enum for table headers by clicking `Table Header` button. It will automatically generate the constants or enum for the table headers in the active sheet. You can then use these constants or enum in your code.

### Close Windows
You can easily close all open windows in VBE by clicking `Close Windows` button. This will close all the open windows in the VBE and give you a clean slate to work on.

### Fully Qualified Sub/FX Ref
You can easily create fully qualified subroutine or function references by clicking `Fully Qualified Sub/FX Ref` button. It will automatically generate the fully qualified reference for the active subroutine or function. This is useful when you want to call a subroutine or function from another module or class.

### Export To Reusable Code Folder
You have added a new function or subroutine to Reusable Code Modules. Just click `Export To Reusable Code Folder` button and it will export the active module to the reusable code folder. This way you can easily add new functions or subroutines to the reusable code folder and use them in your projects.

### Remove Active Code Module
You can easily remove the active code module by clicking `Remove Active Code Module` button. 

### Duplicate Active Code Module
You can easily duplicate the active code module by clicking `Duplicate Active Code Module` button. This will create a copy of the active code module in the same project. 

### Import FX Collection
FXCollection is the most used reusable code module in the Add-In. It contains a lot of utility functions that can be used in your projects. You can easily import the FXCollection module by clicking `Import FX Collection` button. This will import the FXCollection module into your project and you can use the utility functions in your code.
