### Insert Code button
There are 55 code snippets that can be inserted into the current cursor location. And you can easily use your variable names in the code snippets. Like if your variable name is `Data` and you need to loop through your array then just click `Insert Code` just type `a2ltr` and select the `Array 2D Loop Through Row.txt` snippet. It will ask you to specify the Array variable name and you can type `Data` and it will insert the code for you. This way you can use your own variable names in the code snippets.

### Insert Constructor button

### Export To Reusable Code Folder
You have added a new function or subroutine to Reusable Code Modules. Just click `Export To Reusable Code Folder` button and it will export the active module to the reusable code folder. This way you can easily add new functions or subroutines to the reusable code folder and use them in your projects.

### Remove Active Code Module
You can easily remove the active code module by clicking `Remove Active Code Module` button. 

### Duplicate Active Code Module
You can easily duplicate the active code module by clicking `Duplicate Active Code Module` button. This will create a copy of the active code module in the same project.
